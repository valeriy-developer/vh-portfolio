              Hi, I&rsquo;m Valeriy â€” a frontend developer passionate about
              building applications that are not only functional but also
              enjoyable to use. For me, frontend development is the perfect mix
              of logic, creativity, and problem-solving.

                I specialize in React, Next.js, and modern state management
                tools, with a strong focus on performance and clean,
                maintainable code. Over the past years, I&rsquo;ve worked on
                projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to trading systems,
                always striving to make the user&rsquo;s experience smooth and
                intuitive.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love exploring new technologies and improving workflows.
                Outside of coding, I find inspiration in continuous learning and
                creative hobbies, which often bring fresh ideas into my
                development work.
